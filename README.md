## ✍️ How to practice ✍️
Enter sign up or log in.

When you type sign up, enter a name for registration.  
Verify that the name is already registered.  
If the name is not registered, enter a password.  
Afterwards, when the camera turns on, press any key on the keyboard to capture and save your face.

When you type login, enter a name for login.  
If the ID exists, the camera turns on, and if it is the same person through face recognition, a Welcome message appears.  
If it does not continue to be recognized, you can manually press the p button to log in through the password.
