## ✍️ How to practice ✍️
Enter sign up or log in.

When you type sign up, enter a name for registration.  
Verify that the name is already registered.  
If the name is not registered, enter a password.  
Afterwards, when the camera turns on, press any key on the keyboard to capture and save your face.

When you type login, enter a name for login.
